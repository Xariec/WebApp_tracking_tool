# WebApp_tracking_tool

This was a tool that was designed to track player movements in a text based Real Time Strategy game.

The tool uses two daily snapshots of the player map to confirm what secotrs are player controlled and apon uploading the map it will return a list of sectors that are newely acquired. 

Also, it updates a database in Mongo that tracks each sector including history, details, and status.
